# Frequently Asked Questions (F&Q)
How will Snap be updated? Doesn't it not have an auto-updater?
> Snap will have to be manually updated but since updates shouldn't be coming out frequently do to the way the program was created, you should be fine with the latest version you have downloaded.

Will Snap support Spotify in the future?
> We always planned to add support for Spotify but it seems a little harder to-do without an API. We like to keep Snap as simple as possible and already it's getting bulky due to iTunes. We might in the future but for now we are sticking with currently supported players.

Will Snap ever be discontinued?
> We plan to continue developing Snap for as long as possible. In the future we may have to discontinue the project due to our team consisting of high-school students, we have work to finish and more stuff to do. Plus in the future if we get jobs we might not have as much time to work on Snap.

> We should also state that the team is not born in January 1st, 1999. This is just a set age for our development team profile to keep things simple.

# Support And Updates
Snap will continue to be updated and supported until we eventually feel as if the program is complete. This program will continue to be supported and won't be discontinued until necessary. Snap just started and will continue to start thriving as a tool that can be used for OBS Studio and streaming. Thank you for using Snap.
